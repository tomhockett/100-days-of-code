# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Ruby Koans - studied up on RegExp

**Thoughts:** Regular Expressions still feel like "magic" to me.  I'll need to spend much more time on them if I really want to be able to nail it down. For now, I'll just stick to trial-and-error.

## Day 1: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work on Ruby Koans - did the tests on Constants and Methods.  I did a lot of reading on Keyword Arguments and how they make methods easier to read and less buggy. Seems like a great way to enforce a ruleset when requiring arguments for a method call.

I also wrote a program to model a deck of cards to help me grasp Object-Oriented Programming a bit better.  I defined a Deck and a Card class and defined methods to be called on those Objects.

**Thoughts:** The Koans really help me study certain parts of the Ruby language in a cool way.  I end up doing a lot of reading on studying on my own which is great.  I'm really happy with the Card/Deck Classes I wrote and I'd love to see if I could use Rails or Sinatra to take that logic and make something cool (like a game) that can be played on the web!

## Day 2: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:**: Did Ruby Koans Conditions tests - I learned a lot about how to run alternative assignments in Ruby based on conditions.  I can use this assignment in my object models in the card game I'm working on.

**Thoughts:** Today was hard to code. I was really tired and I had to make myself work today.  I wish I could have gotten more done but it was a long day and tomorrow in Thanksgiving. I will try and wake up early and make up some lost time tomorrow morning.

## Day 3: November 23rd, 2017

**Today’s Progress:** Switched gears a bit and started Colt Steele’s Advanced Web Dev Bootcamp. i did a bunch of
work on CSS transitions and pseudo-classes. 

**Thoughts:** i love working with CSS and improving my skills by working with animations was super fun. i also set up my projects in Twello to track my progress.

## Day 4: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Ruby Koans Conditional statements, about blocks, yields, and finished both Triangle projects.  I also worked on project to do simple css/js ripple effects without jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Personal life got in the way of the 100-days project.  I'm not happy about it. Most of what I'm trying to do here is to establish discipline in my coding and in my life.  I've decided not to give up on the challenge and to focus my efforts to be more disciplined.

## Day 5: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Ruby Koans again today and did the Sandwich code lessons.

**Thoughts:** The idea of sandwich code was new to me as I'd never heard of it before. Ruby allows you to write a method that codes the top and bottom functions that get repeated (the bread in this example) and yields to a block of code that you can pass in (the meat.) I need to read more about it, but it does seem to be a powerful way to make my code more DRY.
