# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Ruby Koans - studied up on RegExp

**Thoughts:** Regular Expressions still feel like "magic" to me.  I'll need to spend much more time on them if I really want to be able to nail it down. For now, I'll just stick to trial-and-error.

## Day 1: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work on Ruby Koans - did the tests on Constants and Methods.  I did a lot of reading on Keyword Arguments and how they make methods easier to read and less buggy. Seems like a great way to enforce a ruleset when requiring arguments for a method call.

I also wrote a program to model a deck of cards to help me grasp Object-Oriented Programming a bit better.  I defined a Deck and a Card class and defined methods to be called on those Objects.

**Thoughts:** The Koans really help me study certain parts of the Ruby language in a cool way.  I end up doing a lot of reading on studying on my own which is great.  I'm really happy with the Card/Deck Classes I wrote and I'd love to see if I could use Rails or Sinatra to take that logic and make something cool (like a game) that can be played on the web!
