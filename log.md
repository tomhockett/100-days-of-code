# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Ruby Koans - studied up on RegExp

**Thoughts:** Regular Expressions still feel like "magic" to me.  I'll need to spend much more time on them if I really want to be able to nail it down. For now, I'll just stick to trial-and-error.
